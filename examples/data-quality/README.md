DQV is a standard vocabulary to describe data quality and is proposed along with the DCAT vocabulary to measure the quality of Datasets.
It is based on 3 basic entities: Dimensions, the Metrics that belong to its dimension, and the Measurement for each Metric.
Data Quality can be computed in different levels, eg. data product, dataset, table, column level etc. 
Usually, data quality metrics are measured on a Dataset level and can inform more high level quality metrics on a data product level.
